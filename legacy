<h1>Aria of Sorrow</h1>

<p>An origin settles into place.<br>
Continuation is assumed.</p>

<div class="divider">—</div>

<p>Some endings arrive without ceremony.<br>
What is remembered shapes what follows.<br>
Every outcome begins somewhere unseen.<br>
Certain choices cannot be undone.<br>
What remains tends to endure quietly.</p>

<p>Systems keep their own records.<br>
Sound fades, but echoes do not.<br>
Unchecked structures slowly break down.<br>
Patterns repeat even when denied.<br>
Adjustment usually comes too late.<br>
Effort produces what it can, nothing more.</p>

<p>The same mistake often appears again.<br>
It appears again, unchanged.<br>
What is sent out eventually comes back.<br>
It always comes back.</p>
